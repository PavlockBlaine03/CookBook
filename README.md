# CookBook

## Overview
Cook Book is a GUI application that allows the user to input ingredients with details like calories, cost, and weight, The user can add these ingredients into a "fridge" where they can then access them and create recipes, which will then all be saved for later use in a database that will calculate the total calories and cost. Ingredients that are used up will then be removed from the fridge, or other words database.
